# Customer Segmentation and Profiling

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer data to segment customers into distinct groups based on their demographics, purchasing behaviors, and engagement patterns. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing and personalized customer experiences.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes various data analysis and machine learning techniques to achieve customer profiling and segmentation. Key steps include:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Examining the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Transforming and combining features to improve the effectiveness of segmentation models.
3. **Outlier Detection and Treatment:** Identifying and addressing outliers to refine clustering results.
4. **Clustering Algorithms:** Employing K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to group customers based on their characteristics.
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluating the quality of clusters using metrics such as Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.
6. **Visualization:** Creating visualizations to interpret and communicate clustering outcomes.
7. **Insights and Recommendations:** Extracting actionable insights from the analysis for targeted marketing and improved customer engagement.

## Data Description

The dataset includes diverse attributes related to customer demographics, product purchases, marketing campaign responses, and website engagement.  Features are categorized as follows:

*   **People:** ID, Year_Birth, Education, Marital_Status, Income, Kidhome, Teenhome, Dt_Customer, Recency, Complain
*   **Products:** MntWines, MntFruits, MntMeatProducts, MntFishProducts, MntSweetProducts, MntGoldProds
*   **Promotion:** NumDealsPurchases, AcceptedCmp1, AcceptedCmp2, AcceptedCmp3, AcceptedCmp4, AcceptedCmp5, Response
*   **Place:** NumWebPurchases, NumCatalogPurchases, NumStorePurchases, NumWebVisitsMonth

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:**  Address missing values and inconsistencies in the data.
2. **Data Transformation:** Convert categorical features into numerical representations using one-hot encoding and label encoding.  
3. **Feature Scaling:** Standardize numerical features to ensure that all features contribute equally to the clustering process.
4. **Outlier Removal:** Use appropriate methods (winsorizing) to remove extreme data points that could affect cluster formation.
5. **Clustering:** Apply both K-Means and DBSCAN, adjusting parameters based on data characteristics and performance metrics.
6. **Evaluation:** Evaluate clustering performance with silhouette scores, Davies-Bouldin indices, and visualization techniques (2D and 3D PCA plots).

## Results

The analysis reveals that K-means clustering, after removing outliers, provides the most effective customer segmentation.  DBSCAN performs less effectively due to the presence of noise and overlapping clusters.  Key insights generated by the K-Means model (without outliers) are presented through visualisations and statistical measures, revealing distinct customer segments based on spending patterns and demographics.

## Conclusion

This project provides a strong foundation for understanding customer behavior and developing targeted marketing strategies. The identified customer segments can guide product development, promotional campaigns, and personalized communication efforts.
